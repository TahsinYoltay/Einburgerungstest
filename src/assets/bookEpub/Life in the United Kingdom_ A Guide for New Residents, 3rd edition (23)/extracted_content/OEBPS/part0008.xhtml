<div id="a42Y" class="class_s16z">The UK today</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The UK today is a more diverse society than it was 100 years ago, in both ethnic and religious terms. Post-war immigration means that nearly 10% of the population has a parent or grandparent born outside the UK. The UK continues to be a multinational and multiracial society with a rich and varied culture. This section will tell you about the different parts of the UK and some of the important places. It will also explain some of the UK’s traditions and customs and some of the popular activities that take place.</div>
<div class="class_sc">The nations of the UK</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The UK is located in the north west of Europe. The longest distance on the mainland is from John O’Groats on the north coast of Scotland to Land’s End in the south-west corner of England. It is about 870 miles (approximately 1,400 kilometres).</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Most people live in towns and cities but much of Britain is still countryside. Many people continue to visit the countryside for holidays and for leisure activities such as walking, camping and fishing.</div>

<div class="class_s7j">Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own banknotes, which are valid everywhere in the UK. However, shops and businesses do not have to accept them.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Languages and dialects</div>
<div class="class_s7s">There are many variations in language in the different parts of the UK. The English language has many accents and dialects. In Wales, many people speak Welsh – a completely different language from English – and it is taught in schools and universities. In Scotland, Gaelic (again, a different language) is spoken in some parts of the Highlands and Islands, and in Northern Ireland some people speak Irish Gaelic.</div>

<div class="class_s1a1">Population growth has been faster in more recent years. Migration into the UK and longer life expectancy have played a part in population growth.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The population is very unequally distributed over the four parts of the UK. England more or less consistently makes up 84% of the total population, Wales around 5%, Scotland just over 8%, <span id="page_75"></span>and Northern Ireland less than 3%.</div>
<div class="class_s1aa">An ageing population</div>
<div class="class_s7s">People in the UK are living longer than ever before. This is due to improved living standards and better health care. There are now a record number of people aged 85 and over. This has an impact on the cost of pensions and health care.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Ethnic diversity</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The UK population is ethnically diverse and changing rapidly, especially in large cities such as London. It is not always easy to get an exact picture of the ethnic origin of all the population.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">There are people in the UK with ethnic origins from all over the world. In surveys, the most common ethnic description chosen is white, which includes people of European, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and American descent. Other significant groups are those of Asian, black and mixed descent.</div>
<div class="class_sc">An equal society</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Within the UK, it is a legal requirement that men and women should not be discriminated against because of their gender or because they are, or are not, married. They have equal rights to work, own property, marry and divorce. If they are married, both parents are equally responsible for their children.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Women in Britain today make up about half of the workforce. On average, girls leave school with better qualifications than boys. More women than men study at university.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Employment opportunities for women are much greater than they were in the past. Women work in all sectors of the economy, <span id="page_76"></span>and there are now more women in high-level positions than ever before, including senior managers in traditionally male-dominated occupations. Alongside this, men now work in more varied jobs than they did in the past.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">It is no longer expected that women should stay at home and not work. Women often continue to work after having children. In many families today, both partners work and both share responsibility for childcare and household chores.</div>

<div id="a42Z" class="class_s16z">Religion</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The UK is historically a Christian country. In the 2011 Census, 59% of people identified themselves as Christian. Much smaller proportions identified themselves as Muslim (4.8%), Hindu (1.5%), Sikh (0.8%) and Jewish or Buddhist (both less than 0.5%). There are religious buildings for other religions all over the UK. This includes Islamic mosques, Hindu temples, Jewish synagogues, Sikh gurdwaras and Buddhist temples. However, everyone has the legal right to choose their religion, or to choose not to practise a religion. In the 2011 census, 25% of people said they had no religion.</div>
<div class="class_s1aa">Christian churches</div>
<div id="a456" class="class_s7s">In England, there is a constitutional link between Church and state. <span id="page_77"></span>The official Church of the state is the Church of England (called the Anglican Church in other countries and the Episcopal Church in Scotland and the United States). It is a Protestant Church and has existed since the Reformation in the 1530s (see <a href="part0007.xhtml#a43X">page 27</a> for an explanation).</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The monarch is the head of the Church of England. The spiritual leader of the Church of England is the Archbishop of Canterbury. The monarch has the right to select the Archbishop and other senior church officials, but usually the choice is made by the Prime Minister and a committee appointed by the Church. Several Church of England bishops sit in the House of Lords (see <a href="part0007.xhtml#a460">page 124</a>).</div>
<div class="class_s7j">In Scotland, the national Church is the Church of Scotland, which is a Presbyterian Church. It is governed by ministers and elders. The chairperson of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland is the Moderator, who is appointed for one year only and often speaks on behalf of that Church.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">There is no established Church in Wales or Northern Ireland.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Other Protestant Christian groups in the UK are Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians and Quakers. There are also other denominations of Christianity, the biggest of which is Roman Catholic.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Patron saints’ days</div>
<div class="class_s7s">England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have a national saint, called a patron saint. Each saint has a special day:</div>

<div class="class_sjb">The main Christian festivals</div>
<div class="class_s7s"><span class="class_s43f">Christmas Day</span>, 25 December, celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. It is a public holiday. Many Christians go to church on Christmas Eve (24 December) or on Christmas Day itself.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Christmas is celebrated in a traditional way. People usually spend the day at home and eat a special meal, which often includes roast turkey, Christmas pudding and mince pies. They give gifts, send cards and decorate their houses. Christmas is a special time for children. Very young children believe that Father Christmas (also known as Santa Claus) brings them presents during the night before Christmas Day. Many people decorate a tree in their home.</div>
<div class="class_sge"><div id="a43N" class="class_sga"><img src="image_rsrc1E6.jpg" alt="" class="class_sga1"/></div><div class="class_sgc">A typical Christmas Day meal</div></div>
<div class="class_sgg"><span class="class_s43f">Boxing Day</span> is the day after Christmas Day and is a public holiday.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Easter</span> takes place in March or April. It marks the death of Jesus Christ on Good Friday and his rising from the dead on Easter Sunday. Both Good Friday and the following Monday, called Easter Monday, are public holidays.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The 40 days before Easter are known as Lent. It is a time when Christians take time to reflect and prepare for Easter. Traditionally, people would fast during this period and today many people will give something up, like a favourite food. The day before Lent starts is called Shrove Tuesday, or Pancake Day. People eat pancakes, which were traditionally made to use up foods such as eggs, fat and milk before fasting. Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. There are church services where Christians are marked with an ash cross on their forehead as a symbol of death and sorrow for sin<span id="page_81"></span>.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Easter is also celebrated by people who are not religious. ‘Easter eggs’ are chocolate eggs often given as presents at Easter as a symbol of new life.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Other religious festivals</div>
<div class="class_s7s"><span class="class_s43f">Diwali</span> normally falls in October or November and lasts for five days. It is often called the Festival of Lights. It is celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs. It celebrates the victory of good over evil and the gaining of knowledge. There are different stories about how the festival came about. There is a famous celebration of Diwali in Leicester.</div>
<div class="class_sge"><div id="a44W" class="class_sga"><img src="image_rsrc1EH.jpg" alt="" class="class_sga1"/></div><div class="class_sgc">Diwali is popularly known as the Festival of Lights</div></div>
<div class="class_sgg"><span class="class_s43f">Hannukah</span> is in November or December and is celebrated for eight days. It is to remember the Jews’ struggle for religious freedom. On each day of the festival a candle is lit on a stand of eight candles (called a menorah) to remember the story of the festival, where oil that should have lasted only a day did so for eight<span id="page_82"></span>.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Eid al-Fitr</span> celebrates the end of Ramadan, when Muslims have fasted for a month. They thank Allah for giving them the strength to complete the fast. The date when it takes place changes every year. Muslims attend special services and meals.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Eid ul Adha</span> remembers that the prophet Ibrahim was willing to sacrifice his son when God ordered him to. It reminds Muslims of their own commitment to God. Many Muslims sacrifice an animal to eat during this festival. In Britain this has to be done in a slaughterhouse.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Vaisakhi</span> (also spelled Baisakhi) is a Sikh festival which celebrates the founding of the Sikh community known as the Khalsa. It is celebrated on 14 April each year with parades, dancing and singing.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Other festivals and traditions</div>
<div class="class_s7s"><span class="class_s43f">New Year</span>, 1 January, is a public holiday. People usually celebrate on the night of 31 December (called New Year’s Eve). In Scotland, 31 December is called Hogmanay and 2 January is also a public holiday. For some Scottish people, Hogmanay is a bigger holiday than Christmas.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Valentine’s Day</span>, 14 February, is when lovers exchange cards and gifts. Sometimes people send anonymous cards to someone they secretly admire.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">April Fool’s Day</span>, 1 April, is a day when people play jokes on each other until midday. The television and newspapers often have stories that are April Fool jokes.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Mothering Sunday</span> (or Mother’s Day) is the Sunday three weeks before Easter. Children send cards or buy gifts for their mothers.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Father’s Day</span> is the third Sunday in June. Children send cards or buy gifts for their fathers.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Halloween</span>, 31 October, is an ancient festival and has roots in the pagan festival to mark the beginning of winter. Young people will often dress up in frightening costumes to play ‘trick or treat’. People give them treats to stop them playing tricks on them. A lot of people carve lanterns out of pumpkins and put a candle inside<span id="page_83"></span>.</div>
<div id="a46R" class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Bonfire Night</span>, 5 November, is an occasion when people in Great Britain set off fireworks at home or in special displays. The origin of this celebration was an event in 1605, when a group of Catholics led by Guy Fawkes failed in their plan to kill the Protestant king with a bomb in the Houses of Parliament.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Remembrance Day</span>, 11 November, commemorates those who died fighting for the UK and its allies. Originally it commemorated the dead of the First World War, which ended on 11 November 1918. People wear poppies (the red flower found on the battlefields of the First World War). At 11.00 am there is a two-minute silence and wreaths are laid at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London.</div>

<div class="class_sc">Bank holidays</div>
<div class="class_s7s">As well as those mentioned previously, there are other public holidays each year called bank holidays, when banks and many other businesses are closed for the day. These are of no religious significance. They are at the beginning of May, in late May or early June, and in August. In Northern Ireland, the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne in July is also a public holiday.</div>

<div id="a431" class="class_s16z">Sport</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Sports of all kinds play an important part in many people’s lives. There are several sports that are particularly popular in the UK. Many sporting events take place at major stadiums such as Wembley Stadium in London and the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Local governments and private companies provide sports facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts, football pitches, dry ski slopes and gymnasiums. Many famous sports, including cricket, football, lawn tennis, golf and rugby, began in Britain.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The UK has hosted the Olympic Games on three occasions: 1908, 1948 and 2012. The main Olympic site for the 2012 Games was in Stratford, East London. The British team was very successful, across a wide range of Olympic sports, finishing third in the medal table.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The Paralympic Games for 2012 were also hosted in London. The Paralympics have their origin in the work of Dr Sir Ludwig Guttman, a German refugee, at the Stoke Mandeville hospital in <span id="page_85"></span>Buckinghamshire. Dr Guttman developed new methods of treatment for people with spinal injuries and encouraged patients to take part in exercise and sport.</div>

<div class="class_sc">Cricket</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Cricket originated in England and is now played in many countries. Games can last up to five days but still result in a draw! The idiosyncratic nature of the game and its complex laws are said to reflect the best of the British character and sense of fair play. You may come across expressions such as ‘rain stopped play’, ‘batting on a sticky wicket’, ‘playing a straight bat’, ‘bowled a googly’ or ‘it’s <span id="page_87"></span>just not cricket’, which have passed into everyday usage. The most famous competition is the Ashes, which is a series of Test matches played between England and Australia.</div>
<div class="class_sge"><div id="a45R" class="class_sga"><img src="image_rsrc1GX.jpg" alt="" class="class_sga1"/></div><div class="class_sgc">Cricket is one of the many famous sports originating in Britain</div></div>
<div class="class_sc">Football</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Football is the UK’s most popular sport. It has a long history in the UK and the first professional football clubs were formed in the late 19th century.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have separate leagues in which clubs representing different towns and cities compete. The English Premier League attracts a huge international audience. Many of the best players in the world play in the Premier League. Many UK teams also compete in competitions such as the UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Champions League, against other teams from Europe. Many towns and cities have a professional club and people take great pride in supporting their home team. There can be great rivalry between different football clubs and among fans<span id="page_88"></span>.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Each country in the UK also has its own national team that competes with other national teams across the world in tournaments such as the FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) World Cup and the UEFA European Football Championships. England’s only international tournament victory was at the World Cup of 1966, hosted in the UK.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Football is also a popular sport to play in many local communities, with people playing amateur games every week in parks all over the UK.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Rugby</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Rugby originated in England in the early 19th century and is very popular in the UK today. There are two different types of rugby, which have different rules: union and league. Both have separate leagues and national teams in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (who play with the Irish Republic). Teams from all countries compete in a range of competitions. The most famous rugby union competition is the Six Nations Championship between England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy. The Super League is the most well-known rugby league (club) competition.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Horse racing</div>
<div class="class_s7s">There is a very long history of horse racing in Britain, with evidence of events taking place as far back as Roman times. The sport has a long association with royalty. There are racecourses all over the UK. Famous horse-racing events include: Royal Ascot, a five-day race meeting in Berkshire attended by members of the Royal Family; the Grand National at Aintree near Liverpool; and the Scottish Grand National at Ayr. There is a National Horseracing Museum in Newmarket, Suffolk.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Golf</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The modern game of golf can be traced back to 15th century Scotland. It is a popular sport played socially as well as professionally. There are public and private golf courses all over the UK. St Andrews in Scotland is known as the home of golf<span id="page_89"></span>.</div>
<div id="a46J" class="class_s7j">The Open Championship is the only ‘Major’ tournament held outside the United States. It is hosted by a different golf course every year.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Tennis</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Modern tennis evolved in England in the late 19th century. The first tennis club was founded in Leamington Spa in 1872. The most famous tournament hosted in Britain is The Wimbledon Championships, which takes place each year at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. It is the oldest tennis tournament in the world and the only ‘Grand Slam’ event played on grass.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Water sports</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Sailing continues to be popular in the UK, reflecting our maritime heritage. A British sailor, Sir Francis Chichester, was the first person to sail single-handed around the world passing the Cape of Good Hope (Africa) and Cape Horn (South America), in 1966/67. Two years later, Sir Robin Knox-Johnston became the first person to do this without stopping. Many sailing events are held throughout the UK, the most famous of which is at Cowes on the Isle of Wight.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Rowing is also popular, both as a leisure activity and as a competitive sport. There is a popular yearly race on the Thames between Oxford and Cambridge Universities.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Motor sports</div>
<div class="class_s7s">There is a long history of motor sport in the UK, for both cars and motor cycles. Motor-car racing in the UK started in 1902. The UK continues to be a world leader in the development and manufacture of motor-sport technology. A Formula 1 Grand Prix event is held in the UK each year and a number of British Grand Prix drivers have won the Formula 1 World Championship. Recent British winners include Damon Hill, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Skiing</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Skiing is increasingly popular in the UK. Many people go abroad to ski and there are also dry ski slopes throughout the UK. Skiing on snow may also be possible during the winter. There are five ski centres in Scotland, as well as Europe’s longest dry ski slope near Edinburgh<span id="page_90"></span>.</div>
<div id="a432" class="class_s1e">Arts and culture</div>
<div class="class_sjb">Music</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Music is an important part of British culture, with a rich and varied heritage. It ranges from classical music to modern pop. There are many different venues and musical events that take place across the UK.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The Proms is an eight-week summer season of orchestral classical music that takes place in various venues, including the Royal Albert Hall in London. It has been organised by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) since 1927. The Last Night of the Proms is the most well-known concert and (along with others in the series) is broadcast on television.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Classical music has been popular in the UK for many centuries. <span class="class_s43f">Henry Purcell (1659–95)</span> was the organist at Westminster Abbey. He wrote church music, operas and other pieces, and developed a British style distinct from that elsewhere in Europe. He continues to be influential on British composers.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The German-born composer <span class="class_s43f">George Frederick Handel (1685–1759)</span> spent many years in the UK and became a British citizen in 1727. He wrote the <span class="class_s43r">Water Music</span> for King George I and <span class="class_s43r">Music for the Royal Fireworks</span> for his son, George II. Both these pieces continue to be very popular. Handel also wrote an oratorio, <span class="class_s43r">Messiah</span>, which is sung regularly by choirs, often at Easter time.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">More recently, important composers include <span class="class_s43f">Gustav Holst (1874–1934)</span>, whose work includes <span class="class_s43r">The Planets</span>, a suite of pieces themed around the planets of the solar system. He adapted <span class="class_s43r">Jupiter</span>, part of the <span class="class_s43r">Planets</span> suite, as the tune for <span class="class_s43r">I vow to thee my country</span>, a popular hymn in British churches.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Sir Edward Elgar (1857–1934)</span> was born in Worcester, England. His best-known work is probably the <span class="class_s43r">Pomp and Circumstance Marches</span>. <span class="class_s43r">March No 1 (Land of Hope and Glory)</span> is usually played at the Last Night of the Proms at the Royal Albert Hall.</div>
<div class="class_sge"><div id="a44M" class="class_sga"><img src="image_rsrc1HZ.jpg" alt="" class="class_sga1"/></div><div class="class_sgc">The Royal Albert Hall is the venue for the Last Night of the Proms</div></div>
<div class="class_sgg"><span class="class_s43f">Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872–1958)</span> wrote music for orchestras and choirs. He was strongly influenced by traditional English folk music.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Sir William Walton (1902–83)</span> wrote a wide range of music, from film scores to opera. He wrote marches for the coronations of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II but his best-known works are probably <span class="class_s43r">Façade</span>, which became a ballet, and <span class="class_s43r">Belshazzar’s Feast</span>, which is intended to be sung by a large choir.</div>
<div class="class_s7j"><span class="class_s43f">Benjamin Britten (1913–76)</span> is best known for his operas, which include <span class="class_s43r">Peter Grimes</span> and <span class="class_s43r">Billy Budd</span>. He also wrote <span class="class_s43r">A Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra</span>, which is based on a piece of <span id="page_92"></span>music by Purcell and introduces the listener to the various different sections of an orchestra. He founded the Aldeburgh festival in Suffolk, which continues to be a popular music event of international importance.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Other types of popular music, including folk music, jazz, pop and rock music, have flourished in Britain since the 20th century. Britain has had an impact on popular music around the world, due to the wide use of the English language, the UK’s cultural links with many countries, and British capacity for invention and innovation.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Since the 1960s, British pop music has made one of the most important cultural contributions to life in the UK. Bands including The Beatles and The Rolling Stones continue to have an influence on music both here and abroad. British pop music has continued to innovate – for example, the Punk movement of the late 1970s, and the trend towards boy and girl bands in the 1990s.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">There are many large venues that host music events throughout the year, such as: Wembley Stadium; The O2 in Greenwich, south-east London; and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) in Glasgow.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Festival season takes place across the UK every summer, with major events in various locations. Famous festivals include Glastonbury, the Isle of Wight Festival and Creamfields. Many bands and solo artists, both well-known and up-and-coming, perform at these events.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The National Eisteddfod of Wales is an annual cultural festival which includes music, dance, art and original performances largely in Welsh. It includes a number of important competitions for Welsh poetry.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The Mercury Music Prize is awarded each September for the best album from the UK and Ireland. The Brit Awards is an annual event that gives awards in a range of categories, such as best British group and best British solo artist.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Theatre</div>
<div class="class_s7s">There are theatres in most towns and cities throughout the UK, <span id="page_93"></span>ranging from the large to the small. They are an important part of local communities and often show both professional and amateur productions. London’s West End, also known as ‘Theatreland’, is particularly well known. <span class="class_s43r">The</span> <span class="class_s43r">Mousetrap</span>, a murder-mystery play by Dame Agatha Christie, has been running in the West End since 1952 and has had the longest initial run of any show in history.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">There is also a strong tradition of musical theatre in the UK. In the 19th century, Gilbert and Sullivan wrote comic operas, often making fun of popular culture and politics. These operas include <span class="class_s43r">HMS Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance</span> and <span class="class_s43r">The Mikado</span>. Gilbert and Sullivan’s work is still often staged by professional and amateur groups. More recently, Andrew Lloyd Webber has written the music for shows which have been popular throughout the world, including, in collaboration with Tim Rice, <span class="class_s43r">Jesus Christ Superstar</span> and <span class="class_s43r">Evita</span>, and also <span class="class_s43r">Cats</span> and <span class="class_s43r">The Phantom of the Opera</span>.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">One British tradition is the pantomime. Many theatres produce a pantomime at Christmas time. They are based on fairy stories and are light-hearted plays with music and comedy, enjoyed by family audiences. One of the traditional characters is the Dame, a woman played by a man. There is often also a pantomime horse or cow played by two actors in the same costume.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The Edinburgh Festival takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland, every summer. It is a series of different arts and cultural festivals, with the biggest and most well-known being the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (‘the Fringe’). The Fringe is a showcase of mainly theatre and comedy performances. It often shows experimental work.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The Laurence Olivier Awards take place annually at different venues in London. There are a variety of categories, including best director, best actor and best actress. The awards are named after the British actor Sir Laurence Olivier, later Lord Olivier, who was best known for his roles in various Shakespeare plays.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Art</div>
<div class="class_s7s">During the Middle Ages, most art had a religious theme, particularly wall paintings in churches and illustrations in religious books. Much of this was lost after the Protestant Reformation but wealthy families <span id="page_94"></span>began to collect other paintings and sculptures. Many of the painters working in Britain in the 16th and 17th centuries were from abroad – for example, Hans Holbein and Sir Anthony Van Dyck. British artists, particularly those painting portraits and landscapes, became well known from the 18th century onwards.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Works by British and international artists are displayed in galleries across the UK. Some of the most well-known galleries are The National Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern in London, the National Museum in Cardiff, and the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh.</div>

Previous winners include Damien Hirst and Richard Wright<span id="page_96"></span>.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Architecture</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The architectural heritage of the UK is rich and varied. In the Middle Ages, great cathedrals and churches were built, many of which still stand today. Examples are the cathedrals in Durham, Lincoln, Canterbury and Salisbury. The White Tower in the Tower of London is an example of a Norman castle keep, built on the orders of William the Conqueror (see <a href="part0007.xhtml#a46Y">pages 19</a> and <a href="part0008.xhtml#a45B">115</a>).</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Gradually, as the countryside became more peaceful and landowners became richer, the houses of the wealthy became more elaborate and great country houses such as Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire were built. British styles of architecture began to evolve.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">In the 17th century, Inigo Jones took inspiration from classical architecture to design the Queen’s House at Greenwich and the Banqueting House in Whitehall in London. Later in the century, Sir Christopher Wren helped develop a British version of the ornate styles popular in Europe in buildings such as the new St Paul’s Cathedral.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">In the 18th century, simpler designs became popular. The Scottish architect Robert Adam influenced the development of architecture in the UK, Europe and America. He designed the inside decoration as well as the building itself in great houses such as Dumfries House in Scotland. His ideas influenced architects in cities such as Bath, where the Royal Crescent was built.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">In the 19th century, the medieval ‘gothic’ style became popular again. As cities expanded, many great public buildings were built in this style. The Houses of Parliament and St Pancras Station were built at this time, as were the town halls in cities such as Manchester and Sheffield.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">In the 20th century, Sir Edwin Lutyens had an influence throughout the British Empire. He designed New Delhi to be the seat of government in India. After the First World War, he was responsible for many war memorials throughout the world, including the Cenotaph in Whitehall. The Cenotaph is the site of the annual Remembrance Day service attended by the Queen, politicians and foreign ambassadors (see <a href="part0008.xhtml#a46R">page 83</a>)<span id="page_97"></span>.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The firms of modern British architects continue to work on major projects throughout the world as well as within the UK. These include those of Sir Norman Foster (1935–), Lord (Richard) Rogers (1933–) and Dame Zaha Hadid (1950–2016).</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Alongside the development of architecture, garden design and landscaping have played an important role in the UK. In the 18th century, Lancelot ‘Capability’ Brown designed the grounds around country houses so that the landscape appeared to be natural, with grass, trees and lakes. He often said that a place had ‘capabilities’. Later, Gertrude Jekyll often worked with Edwin Lutyens to design colourful gardens around the houses he designed. Gardens continue to be an important part of homes in the UK. The annual Chelsea Flower Show showcases garden design from Britain and around the world.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Fashion and design</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Britain has produced many great designers, from Thomas Chippendale (who designed furniture in the 18th century) to Clarice Cliff (who designed Art Deco ceramics) to Sir Terence Conran (a 20th-century interior designer). Leading fashion designers of recent years include Mary Quant, Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Literature</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The UK has a prestigious literary history and tradition. Several British writers, including the novelist Sir William Golding, the poet Seamus Heaney, and the playwright Harold Pinter, have won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other authors have become well known in popular fiction. Agatha Christie’s detective stories are read all over the world and Ian Fleming’s books introduced James Bond. In 2003, <span class="class_s43r">The Lord of the Rings</span> by JRR Tolkien was voted the country’s best-loved novel.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The Man Booker Prize for Fiction is awarded annually for the best fiction novel written by an author from the Commonwealth, Ireland or Zimbabwe. It has been awarded since 1968. Past winners include Ian McEwan, Hilary Mantel and Julian Barnes.</div>

<div class="class_s1aa">British poets</div>
<div class="class_s7s">British poetry is among the richest in the world. The Anglo-Saxon poem <span class="class_s43r">Beowulf</span> tells of its hero’s battles against monsters and is still translated into modern English. Poems which survive from the Middle Ages include Chaucer’s <span class="class_s43r">Canterbury Tales</span> and a poem called <span class="class_s43r">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</span>, about one of the knights at the court of King Arthur.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">As well as plays, Shakespeare wrote many sonnets (poems which must be 14 lines long) and some longer poems. As Protestant ideas spread, a number of poets wrote poems inspired by their religious views. One of these was John Milton, who wrote <span class="class_s43r">Paradise Lost</span>.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Other poets, including William Wordsworth, were inspired by nature. Sir Walter Scott wrote poems inspired by Scotland and the traditional stories and songs from the area on the borders of Scotland and England. He also wrote novels, many of which were set in Scotland.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Poetry was very popular in the 19th century, with poets such as William Blake, John Keats, Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Robert and Elizabeth Browning. Later, many poets – for example, Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon – were inspired to write about their experiences in the First World War. More recently, popular poets have included Sir Walter de la Mare, John Masefield, Sir John Betjeman and Ted Hughes.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Some of the best-known poets are buried or commemorated in Poet’s Corner in Westminster Abbey.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Some famous lines include:</div>
<div class="class_s7j">‘Oh, to be in England now that April’s there</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">And whoever wakes in England sees, some morning, unaware,</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">Round the elm-tree bole are in tiny leaf</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">While the Chaffinch sings on the orchard bough</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">In England – Now!’</div>

<div class="class_s7j">‘She walks in beauty, like the night</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">Of cloudless climes and starry skies;</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">And all that’s best of dark and bright</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">Meet in her aspect and her eyes’</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">(Lord Byron, 1788–1824 – <span class="class_s43r">She Walks in Beauty</span>)</div>
<div class="class_s7j">‘I wander’d lonely as a cloud</div>

<div class="class_s1nc">(William Wordsworth, 1770–1850 – <span class="class_s43r">The Daffodils</span>)</div>
<div class="class_s7j">‘Tyger! Tyger! Burning bright</div>
<div class="class_s1nc">In the forests of the night,</div>

<div id="a433" class="class_s16z">Leisure</div>
<div class="class_s7s">People in the UK spend their leisure time in many different ways.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Gardening</div>
<div class="class_s7s">A lot of people have gardens at home and will spend their free time looking after them. Some people rent additional land called ‘an allotment’, where they grow fruit and vegetables. Gardening and flower shows range from major national exhibitions to small local events. Many towns have garden centres selling plants and gardening equipment. There are famous gardens to visit throughout the UK, including Kew Gardens, Sissinghurst and Hidcote in England, Crathes Castle and Inveraray Castle in Scotland, Bodnant Garden in Wales, and Mount Stewart in Northern Ireland.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The countries that make up the UK all have flowers which are particularly associated with them and which are sometimes worn on national saints’ days:</div>

<div class="class_sc">Shopping</div>
<div class="class_s7s">There are many different places to go shopping in the UK. Most towns and cities have a central shopping area, which is called the town centre. Undercover shopping centres are also common – these might be in town centres or on the outskirts of a town or city. Most shops in the UK are open seven days a week, although trading hours on Sundays and public holidays are generally reduced. Many towns also have markets on one or more days a week, where stallholders sell a variety of goods.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Cooking and food</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Many people in the UK enjoy cooking. They often invite each other to their homes for dinner. A wide variety of food is eaten in the UK because of the country’s rich cultural heritage and diverse population.</div>

<div class="class_sna">Films</div>
<div class="class_s1t">British film industry</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The UK has had a major influence on modern cinema.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Films were first shown publicly in the UK in 1896 and film screenings very quickly became popular. From the beginning, British film makers became famous for clever special effects and this continues to be an area of British expertise. From the early days of the cinema, British actors have worked in both the UK and USA. Sir Charles (Charlie) Chaplin became famous in silent movies for his tramp character and was one of many British actors to make a career in Hollywood.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">British studios flourished in the 1930s. Eminent directors included Sir Alexander Korda and Sir Alfred Hitchcock, who later left for Hollywood and remained an important film director until his death in 1980. During the Second World War, British movies (for example, <span class="class_s43r">In Which We Serve</span>) played an important part in boosting morale. Later, British directors including Sir David Lean and Ridley Scott found great success both in the UK and internationally.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The 1950s and 1960s were a high point for British comedies, including <span class="class_s43r">Passport to Pimlico</span>, <span class="class_s43r">The Ladykillers</span> and, later, the <span class="class_s43r">Carry On</span> films.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Many of the films now produced in the UK are made by foreign companies, using British expertise. Some of the most commercially successful films of all time, including two of the highest-grossing film franchises (Harry Potter and James Bond), have been produced in the UK. Ealing Studios has a claim to being the oldest continuously working film studio facility in the world. Britain continues to be particularly strong in special effects and animation. One example is the work of Nick Park, who has won four Oscars for his animated films, including three for films featuring Wallace and Gromit.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Actors such as Sir Lawrence Olivier, David Niven, Sir Rex Harrison and Richard Burton starred in a wide variety of popular films. British actors continue to be popular and continue to win awards throughout the world. Recent British actors to have won Oscars <span id="page_104"></span>include Colin Firth, Sir Antony Hopkins, Dame Judi Dench, Kate Winslet and Tilda Swinton.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">The annual British Academy Film Awards, hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), are the British equivalent of the Oscars.</div>

<div class="class_sc">British comedy</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The traditions of comedy and satire, and the ability to laugh at ourselves, are an important part of the UK character.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Medieval kings and rich nobles had jesters who told jokes and made fun of people in the Court. Later, Shakespeare included comic characters in his plays. In the 18th century, political cartoons attacking prominent politicians – and, sometimes, the monarch or other members of the Royal Family – became increasingly popular. In the 19th century, satirical magazines began to be published. The most famous was <span class="class_s43r">Punch</span>, which was published for the first time in the 1840s. Today, political cartoons continue to be published <span id="page_105"></span>in newspapers, and magazines such as <span class="class_s43r">Private Eye</span> continue the tradition of satire.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Comedians were a popular feature of British music hall, a form of variety theatre which was very common until television became the leading form of entertainment in the UK. Some of the people who had performed in the music halls in the 1940s and 1950s, such as Morecambe and Wise, became stars of television.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Television comedy developed its own style. Situation comedies, or sitcoms, which often look at family life and relationships in the workplace, remain popular. Satire has also continued to be important, with shows like <span class="class_s43r">That Was The Week That Was</span> in the 1960s and <span class="class_s43r">Spitting Image</span> in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1969, <span class="class_s43r">Monty Python’s Flying Circus</span> introduced a new type of progressive comedy. Stand-up comedy, where a solo comedian talks to a live audience, has become popular again in recent years.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Television and radio</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Many different television (TV) channels are available in the UK. Some are free to watch and others require a paid subscription. British television shows a wide variety of programmes. Popular programmes include regular soap operas such as <span class="class_s43r">Coronation Street</span> and <span class="class_s43r">EastEnders</span>. In Scotland, some Scotland-specific programmes are shown and there is also a channel with programmes in the Gaelic language. There is a Welsh-language channel in Wales. There are also programmes specific to Northern Ireland and some programmes broadcast in Irish Gaelic.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Everyone in the UK with a TV, computer or other medium which can be used for watching TV must have a television licence. One licence covers all of the equipment in one home, except when people rent different rooms in a shared house and each has a separate tenancy agreement – those people must each buy a separate licence. People over 75 can apply for a free TV licence and blind people can get a 50% discount. You will receive a fine of up to £1,000 if you watch TV but do not have a TV licence.</div>
<div id="a44R" class="class_s7j">The money from TV licences is used to pay for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). This is a British public service <span id="page_106"></span>broadcaster providing television and radio programmes. The BBC is the largest broadcaster in the world. Although it receives some state funding, it is independent of the government. Other UK channels are primarily funded through advertisements and subscriptions.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">There are also many different radio stations in the UK. Some broadcast nationally and others in certain cities or regions. There are radio stations that play certain types of music and some broadcast in regional languages such as Welsh or Gaelic. Like television, BBC radio stations are funded by TV licences and other radio stations are funded through advertisements.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Social networking</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Social networking websites such as Facebook and Twitter are a popular way for people to stay in touch with friends, organise social events, and share photos, videos and opinions. Many people use social networking on their mobile phones when out and about.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Pubs and night clubs</div>
<div class="class_s7s">Public houses (pubs) are an important part of the UK social culture. Many people enjoy meeting friends in the pub. Most communities will have a ‘local’ pub that is a natural focal point for social activities. Pub quizzes are popular. Pool and darts are traditional pub games. To buy alcohol in a pub or night club you must be 18 or over, but people under that age may be allowed in some pubs with an adult. When they are 16, people can drink wine or beer with a meal in a hotel or restaurant (including eating areas in pubs) as long as they are with someone over 18.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Pubs are usually open during the day from 11.00 am (12 noon on Sundays). Night clubs with dancing and music usually open and close later than pubs. The licensee decides the hours that the pub or night club is open.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Betting and gambling</div>
<div class="class_s7s">In the UK, people often enjoy a gamble on sports or other events. There are also casinos in many places. You have to be 18 to go into betting shops or gambling clubs. There is a National Lottery for <span id="page_107"></span>which draws are made every week. You can enter by buying a ticket or a scratch card. People under 16 are not allowed to participate in the National Lottery.</div>
<div class="class_sc">Pets</div>
<div class="class_s7s">A lot of people in the UK have pets such as cats or dogs. They might have them for company or because they enjoy looking after them. It is against the law to treat a pet cruelly or to neglect it. All dogs in public places must wear a collar showing the name and address of the owner. The owner is responsible for keeping the dog under control and for cleaning up after the animal in a public place.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Vaccinations and medical treatment for animals are available from veterinary surgeons (vets). There are charities which may help people who cannot afford to pay a vet.</div>
<div id="a434" class="class_s16z">Places of interest</div>
<div class="class_s7s">The UK has a large network of public footpaths in the countryside. There are also many opportunities for mountain biking, mountaineering and hill walking. There are 15 national parks in England, Wales and Scotland. They are areas of protected countryside that everyone can visit, and where people live, work and look after the landscape.</div>
<div class="class_s7j">There are many museums in the UK, which range from small community museums to large national and civic collections. Famous landmarks exist in towns, cities and the countryside throughout the UK. Most of them are open to the public to view (generally for a charge).</div>
<div class="class_s7j">Many parts of the countryside and places of interest are kept open by the National Trust in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the National Trust for Scotland. Both are charities that work to preserve important buildings, coastline and countryside in the UK. The National Trust was founded in 1895 by three volunteers. There are now more than 61,000 volunteers helping to keep the organisation running<span id="page_108"></span>.</div>
