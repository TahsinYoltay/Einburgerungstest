    <p>The UK is founded on the values of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, and mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs.</p>

    <h1>History of the UK</h1>
    
    <p>The United Kingdom has a rich and complex history spanning thousands of years. Understanding this history helps us appreciate how modern British values and institutions developed.</p>
    
    <h2>Ancient Britain</h2>
    <p>The British Isles have been inhabited for thousands of years. Early peoples included the Celts, who arrived around 500 BC and established settlements across Britain and Ireland.</p>
    
    <p>In 43 AD, the Romans invaded Britain under Emperor Claudius. Roman rule lasted for nearly 400 years and brought:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Roads and infrastructure</li>
        <li>Towns and cities</li>
        <li>Laws and government</li>
        <li>Christianity</li>

        <li>The beginning of English literature</li>

    </ul>
    
    <div class="info-box">
