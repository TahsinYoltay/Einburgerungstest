        <h1>Early Britain</h1>
        
        <h2>Stone Age Britain</h2>
        <p>The first people to live in Britain were hunter-gatherers, in what we call the Stone Age. For much of the Stone Age, Britain was connected to the continent by a land bridge. People came and went, following the herds of deer and horses which they hunted. Britain only became permanently separated from the continent by the English Channel about 10,000 years ago.</p>

        <h2>The First Farmers</h2>
        <p>The first farmers arrived in Britain 6,000 years ago. The ancestors of these first farmers probably came from south-east Europe. These people built houses, tombs and monuments on the land. One of these monuments, Stonehenge, still stands in what is now the English county of Wiltshire. Stonehenge was probably a special gathering place for seasonal ceremonies. Many other Stone Age sites have been found across Britain.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Key Point:</strong> Stonehenge was built by Britain's first farmers and was likely used for seasonal ceremonies.
        </div>

        <h2>The Bronze Age</h2>
        <p>Around 4,000 years ago, people learned to make bronze. We call this period the Bronze Age. People lived in roundhouses and buried their dead in tombs called round barrows. The people of the Bronze Age were accomplished metalworkers who made many beautiful objects in bronze and gold, including tools, ornaments and weapons. The Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age, when people learned to make weapons and tools with iron.</p>

        <h2>The Celts</h2>
        <p>The people who lived in Britain during the Iron Age are often called the Celts. The Celts were not a single tribe but were made up of many different tribal groups which shared similar languages, religious beliefs, traditions and culture. They lived across most of Europe, not just in Britain. The word 'Celt' comes from the Greeks, who called them 'Keltoi' or 'barbarians'.</p>

        <p>In Britain, the Celts spoke languages that are related to the modern day Welsh, Gaelic and Cornish languages. Cornish is now spoken in Cornwall and Celtic languages are still spoken in some parts of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Celts had a sophisticated culture and economy. They made the first coins to be minted in Britain, some inscribed with the names of Iron Age kings. This marks the beginnings of British history.</p>

        <h1>Roman Britain</h1>

        <h2>Julius Caesar's Invasions</h2>
        <p>In 55 and 54 BC, Julius Caesar led Roman invasions of Britain. However, the Romans did not stay long. The Roman Emperor Claudius led the Roman army in a new invasion in AD 43. This time, there was resistance from some of the British tribes but the Romans were successful in occupying almost all of Britain. One of the tribal leaders who fought against the Romans was Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni in what is now eastern England. She is still remembered today and there is a statue of her on Westminster Bridge in London, near the Houses of Parliament.</p>

        <div class="highlight">

            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Areas of Roman Control</h2>
        <p>The Romans were not able to conquer Scotland. They built a wall across the north of England to keep out the Picts (ancestors of the Scottish people). The wall was called Hadrian's Wall, named after the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who ordered its construction. Parts of Hadrian's Wall, including the forts that were built along it, can still be seen today. It is a popular area for walkers and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

        <h2>Roman Influence on Britain</h2>
        <p>The Romans remained in Britain for 400 years. They built roads and public buildings, created a structure of law, and introduced new plants and animals. It was during the Roman occupation that the first Christian communities began to appear in Britain.</p>

        <h1>The Anglo-Saxons and Vikings</h1>

        <h2>The Anglo-Saxon Settlement</h2>
        <p>The Roman army left Britain in AD 410 to defend other parts of the Roman Empire and never returned. Britain was again invaded by tribes from northern Europe: the Jutes, the Angles and the Saxons. The languages they spoke are the basis of modern-day English. Battles were fought against these invaders but, by about AD 600, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were established in Britain. These kingdoms were mainly in what is now England. The burial place of one of the kings was at Sutton Hoo in modern Suffolk. This king was buried with treasure and armour, all of which can be seen today in the British Museum in London.</p>

        <h2>Anglo-Saxon Culture and Religion</h2>
        <p>The Anglo-Saxons were not Christians when they first came to Britain but, over time, many converted to Christianity. Anglo-Saxon kings were advised by a council of nobles and senior clergy called the Witan. The Anglo-Saxons gave us many of the words we still use today, including the names of a number of days of the week. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are named after Anglo-Saxon gods.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Anglo-Saxon Contributions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Basis of modern English language</li>
                <li>Names of weekdays (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday)</li>
                <li>The Witan (council system)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Vikings</h2>
        <p>The Vikings came from Denmark and Norway. They first visited Britain in AD 789 to raid and take away goods, but later many came to stay. The Anglo-Saxons fought fiercely against the Vikings. King Alfred the Great, who ruled from 871 to 899, was one of the most successful Anglo-Saxon kings. He defeated the Vikings in many battles but was never able to drive them completely out of Britain. A treaty was agreed that split the country between the Anglo-Saxons and the Vikings. The area where the Vikings ruled was called the Danelaw. Most of the Vikings were not Christians when they first came to Britain but many later converted.</p>

        <h2>King Alfred the Great</h2>
        <p>Alfred was not only a great warrior but is also remembered for promoting education and establishing the rule of law. He founded schools and invited scholars from Europe to come to Britain. Because of his contribution to education, he is the only monarch to be called 'the Great'. Alfred also established the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a yearly written record of events, and is credited with starting the English navy.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Alfred the Great's Achievements:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Defeated Vikings in many battles</li>
                <li>Promoted education and founded schools</li>
                <li>Established rule of law</li>
                <li>Started the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</li>
                <li>Founded the English navy</li>
                <li>Only British monarch called 'the Great'</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Unification of England</h2>
        <p>Alfred's successors continued to fight the Vikings. His grandson, Athelstan, was the first to be called 'King of England' in 927. By 954, the Anglo-Saxons had regained control of all of England, although they were not able to conquer Scotland, Wales or Ireland.</p>

        <h1>The Norman Conquest</h1>

        <h2>Events Leading to 1066</h2>
        <p>In 1066, an invasion led to the last time that Britain was successfully invaded by a foreign army. The invasion happened because there was a dispute over who should be the next king after the death of Edward the Confessor, the Anglo-Saxon king of England. A number of people claimed the throne. Harold, Earl of Wessex (Harold II), was crowned king of England. William, the Duke of Normandy (in what is now northern France), also claimed the English throne. He said that both Edward the Confessor and Harold had promised that he could be king.</p>

        <h2>The Battle of Hastings</h2>
        <p>Harold's army fought William's army at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Harold was killed in the battle and William became king. He is known as William the Conqueror. The Norman Conquest was the last successful foreign invasion of England.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Key Facts about 1066:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Battle of Hastings fought between Harold II and William of Normandy</li>
                <li>Harold II was killed in battle</li>
                <li>William became king (William the Conqueror)</li>
                <li>Last successful foreign invasion of England</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Domesday Book</h2>
        <p>The Normans used a system of land ownership called feudalism. The king gave land to his lords in return for help in war. Landowners had to send certain numbers of men to serve in the army. In turn, the lords gave land to their knights, and the knights gave land to peasants to grow food. In 1086, William ordered a complete survey of England to find out how much tax he could raise. The survey became known as the Domesday Book and is kept today in The National Archives in London. It was probably the first time such a survey had been conducted anywhere in the world.</p>

        <h2>Norman Architecture</h2>
        <p>The Normans also brought changes to the culture and language of Britain. Norman French, the language of the royal court, slowly combined with Anglo-Saxon English to become one language. Many Norman French words are still used today. The Normans were great builders. They built impressive castles, churches and cathedrals. Some of these can still be seen today, including the Tower of London, Edinburgh Castle and Durham Cathedral.</p>
