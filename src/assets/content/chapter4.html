        <h1>Migration to Britain</h1>
        
        <h2>Early Migration</h2>
        <p>Britain has always been a nation of immigrants. In prehistoric times, people came to Britain from the European mainland. Since that time, people from many different countries have come to make Britain their home.</p>

        <p>For a long time, most migrants to Britain came from the continent of Europe. The Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Jutes, Vikings and Normans were all peoples who came to Britain from Europe. From the 16th century onwards, an increasing number of people came to Britain from other parts of the world.</p>

        <h2>The Huguenots</h2>
        <p>The first significant wave of immigrants from outside mainland Europe came in the 1680s, when French Protestants, called Huguenots, came to Britain to escape religious persecution in France. Many were skilled craftsmen and brought new skills to British industry.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The Huguenots (1680s):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>French Protestants fleeing religious persecution</li>
                <li>Skilled craftsmen who contributed to British industry</li>
                <li>First significant non-European immigrant group</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Jewish Migration</h2>
        <p>From 1880 to 1910, large numbers of Jewish people came to Britain to escape persecution in the Russian Empire and other parts of Eastern Europe. Many settled in London, particularly in the East End. This was a period of great change in British society and there was sometimes tension between existing communities and new immigrants.</p>

        <h2>Irish Immigration</h2>
        <p>Ireland was separate from Britain but under British rule. During the 19th century, Ireland suffered a number of famines. The worst of these was in the 1840s, when many people died or were forced to leave Ireland. Some came to England, others went to the USA and elsewhere. Irish people continued to come to Britain to look for work.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Irish Immigration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>19th century famines, especially in the 1840s</li>
                <li>Many died or emigrated to Britain, USA, and elsewhere</li>
                <li>Continued migration for work opportunities</li>

        <h1>The Empire and Commonwealth</h1>

        <h2>The British Empire</h2>
        <p>During the Victorian period, the British Empire became the largest the world had ever seen. At its height, it covered a quarter of the world's surface and contained a quarter of the world's population. Many people were encouraged to leave Britain to help populate the new colonies. Between 1853 and 1913, as many as 13 million British citizens left Britain to settle in the dominions and other colonies.</p>

        <h2>Migration from the Empire and Commonwealth</h2>
        <p>After the Second World War, there was a huge task of rebuilding Britain. With not enough people to do the work, the British government encouraged workers from Ireland and other parts of Europe to come to the UK. In 1948, people from the West Indies were also invited to come and work.</p>

        <h3>The Windrush Generation</h3>
        <p>The first group of West Indian immigrants came on a ship called the Empire Windrush in 1948. Many West Indians served in the British armed forces or worked in Britain during the Second World War. They were therefore familiar with Britain and in some cases had family ties to the country.</p>

        <div class="timeline">
            <strong>Post-War Immigration Timeline:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1948:</strong> Empire Windrush brings first group from West Indies</li>
                <li><strong>1950s-1960s:</strong> Workers from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka</li>
                <li><strong>1960s:</strong> Many people from Caribbean, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh</li>
                <li><strong>1970s:</strong> Ugandan Asians expelled by Idi Amin</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Asian Immigration</h2>
        <p>During the 1950s, there was still a shortage of labour in Britain. Further immigration was therefore encouraged and many people came from the Indian sub-continent (which included Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka). During the 1960s, immigrants also came to Britain from the Caribbean, India, Pakistan and what is now Bangladesh. Immigrants were attracted by better employment opportunities and higher wages than were available in their home countries.</p>

        <h3>Ugandan Asians</h3>
        <p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Uganda was ruled by Idi Amin, who expelled all people of Indian origin from the country. Many of these people, who came to be known as Ugandan Asians, settled in Britain.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Reasons for Post-War Immigration:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Rebuilding Britain after World War II</li>
                <li>Labour shortages in key industries</li>
                <li>Better employment opportunities and wages</li>
                <li>Political persecution (e.g., Ugandan Asians)</li>

        <h1>Modern Migration</h1>

        <h2>European Union Migration</h2>
        <p>Since the 1970s, there has been less immigration to Britain from the former colonies and more from European Union (EU) countries. Rules within the EU allow the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. This means that any citizen of an EU member state has the right to work in any other member state.</p>

        <h2>Recent Immigration Patterns</h2>
        <p>In 2004, ten new countries joined the EU, including Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia. Immigration to the UK from these countries increased significantly. In more recent years, people have also come to the UK seeking asylum from countries such as Somalia, Afghanistan, and Syria due to persecution or conflict.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Modern Immigration Sources:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>EU countries (especially after 2004 expansion)</li>
                <li>Asylum seekers from conflict zones</li>
                <li>Economic migrants from various countries</li>
                <li>Students from around the world</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Impact of Immigration</h2>
        <p>Immigration has had a significant impact on British culture. New communities have brought their own cultures, traditions, food and languages. This has created a rich and diverse cultural landscape. Many festivals celebrated in Britain today have their origins in other countries, including Chinese New Year, Eid, and Diwali.</p>

        <p>At the same time, immigrants have had to adapt to British culture and many have adopted British customs while maintaining their own cultural identity. This process of integration continues to shape modern Britain.</p>
