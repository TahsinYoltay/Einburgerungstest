        <h1>The British Constitution</h1>
        
        <p>Unlike many other countries, the UK does not have a constitution that is contained in a single written document. Instead, the British constitution comes from a number of sources, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Statute law (Acts of Parliament)</li>
            <li>Common law (decisions made by judges)</li>
            <li>Conventions (traditions)</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Key Constitutional Principle:</strong> The UK is a constitutional monarchy. This means that the monarch is the ceremonial head of state, but it is Parliament that has the real power to make decisions.
        </div>

        <h2>Constitutional Monarchy</h2>
        <p>The UK is a constitutional monarchy. This means that although there is a monarch, it is Parliament that has the power. The monarch acts on the advice of the government and cannot make important decisions alone.</p>

        <h2>Rule of Law</h2>
        <p>An important principle of the British system of government is that everyone, including the monarch and politicians, must obey the law. Another important principle is that the government cannot collect taxes or change the law without Parliament's agreement.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="monarch">
        <h1>The Monarch</h1>

        <h2>Head of State</h2>
        <p>The monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II) is the head of state of the UK. As a constitutional monarch, she reigns but does not rule. This means she is politically neutral and acts on the advice of her government ministers.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The Monarch's Role:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Head of state, not head of government</li>
                <li>Politically neutral</li>
                <li>Acts on advice of government ministers</li>
                <li>Ceremonial duties and state functions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Royal Prerogative</h2>
        <p>The monarch has important ceremonial roles. These include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Opening Parliament each year and giving the Queen's Speech</li>
            <li>Giving Royal Assent to Bills passed by Parliament</li>
            <li>Meeting with the Prime Minister every week</li>
            <li>Appointing important public officials</li>
            <li>Awarding honours such as peerages, knighthoods and other awards</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Head of the Commonwealth</h2>
        <p>The monarch is also the ceremonial head of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth is an association of countries that support each other and work together towards shared goals in democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Most Commonwealth countries are former colonies of the British Empire, but membership is voluntary.</p>

        <h2>Head of the Church of England</h2>
        <p>The monarch is the constitutional head of the Church of England, a position that dates back to the 16th century. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual leader of the Church of England.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Multiple Roles of the Monarch:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Head of state of the UK</li>
                <li>Head of the Commonwealth</li>
                <li>Head of the Church of England</li>
                <li>Head of the armed forces</li>
            </ul>

    <section id="system-government">
        <h1>The System of Government</h1>

        <h2>Parliament</h2>
        <p>The UK Parliament is made up of the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the monarch. Parliament has the power to make new laws or change existing ones.</p>

        <h3>The House of Commons</h3>
        <p>The House of Commons is regarded as the more important of the two houses of Parliament. It is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs), each of whom represents an area of the country called a constituency. There are 650 constituencies in the UK. MPs are elected by the people in a general election, which must take place at least every five years.</p>

        <div class="process-box">
            <strong>How Laws are Made:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Bill introduced in either House of Commons or House of Lords</li>
                <li>First reading (formal presentation)</li>
                <li>Second reading (main debate on principles)</li>
                <li>Committee stage (detailed examination)</li>
                <li>Report stage (further amendments)</li>
                <li>Third reading (final debate)</li>
                <li>Bill goes to other house</li>
                <li>Royal Assent (monarch's formal approval)</li>
                <li>Bill becomes an Act of Parliament (law)</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <h3>The House of Lords</h3>
        <p>Members of the House of Lords (known as peers) are not elected by the people. The House of Lords is made up of:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Life peers (appointed for their expertise in different fields)</li>
            <li>A small number of hereditary peers</li>
            <li>Bishops from the Church of England</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The House of Lords can suggest amendments or changes to laws, but the House of Commons has the right to overrule the House of Lords.</p>

        <h2>The Prime Minister</h2>
        <p>The Prime Minister (PM) is the political leader of the UK. He or she is the leader of the political party in power and is the person who appoints ministers to run government departments. The Prime Minister is based at 10 Downing Street, in central London.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>The Prime Minister's Role:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Political leader of the UK</li>
                <li>Leader of the party in power</li>
                <li>Appoints government ministers</li>
                <li>Lives and works at 10 Downing Street</li>
                <li>Meets weekly with the monarch</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>The Cabinet</h2>
        <p>The Prime Minister appoints about 20 senior MPs to become ministers in charge of government departments. These ministers form the Cabinet, a committee which meets regularly to decide on government policy. Many decisions are made by the Cabinet.</p>

        <h2>The Opposition</h2>
        <p>The second-largest party in the House of Commons is called the opposition. The leader of the opposition usually becomes Prime Minister if his or her party wins the next general election. The leader of the opposition and senior opposition MPs form the Shadow Cabinet, each with responsibility for opposing and scrutinising the work of government ministers.</p>

        <h2>Political Parties</h2>
        <p>Anyone who is 18 or over can stand for election as an MP, but they are unlikely to win unless they are supported by a political party. Political parties are groups of people who share similar political opinions. The main political parties in the UK at present are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Conservative Party</strong> (also known as the Tories)</li>
            <li><strong>Labour Party</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Liberal Democrats</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Scottish National Party (SNP)</strong> - campaigns for Scottish independence</li>
            <li><strong>Plaid Cymru</strong> - a Welsh nationalist party</li>
            <li><strong>Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)</strong> and <strong>Sinn Fein</strong> - the main parties in Northern Ireland</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="devolution">
        <h1>Devolution</h1>

        <h2>What is Devolution?</h2>
        <p>Since 1997, some powers have been devolved (transferred) from the central government in Westminster to give people in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland more control over matters that directly affect them. There is now:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Scottish Parliament</li>
            <li>The Welsh Assembly (Senedd Cymru)</li>
            <li>The Northern Ireland Assembly</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>Devolved Powers include:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Health</li>
                <li>Agriculture</li>
                <li>Justice and policing (Scotland and Northern Ireland)</li>
                <li>Transport</li>
                <li>Local government</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Reserved Powers</h2>
        <p>The UK Parliament still keeps control of areas such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Defence and national security</li>
            <li>Foreign policy</li>
            <li>Immigration</li>
            <li>Taxation</li>
            <li>Economic policy</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>England</h2>
        <p>England continues to be governed by the UK Parliament in Westminster for all matters. There is no separate English parliament.</p>

        <div class="warning">
            <strong>Important:</strong> England does not have its own devolved parliament. All English matters are decided by the UK Parliament at Westminster.

        <h1>Elections</h1>

        <h2>UK Parliamentary Elections</h2>

        <h2>Who Can Vote?</h2>
        <p>Most UK, Irish and Commonwealth citizens who are 18 or over and permanently resident in the UK can vote in all public elections. Citizens of EU countries who are resident in the UK can vote in all elections except General Elections to the UK Parliament.</p>

        <div class="highlight">

        <h2>European Parliament Elections</h2>
        <p>Elections to the European Parliament use a system of proportional representation, where parties gain seats in proportion to the number of votes they receive.</p>

            <ul>
